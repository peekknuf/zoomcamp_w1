# First week of Zoomcamp: Docker and Postgres

Learnings and work from the course - [Data Engineering Zoomcamp by DataTalksClub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp)

Using Spark and parquet file instead of regular Pandas and CSV proved to be a much more challenging experience.
Multiple issues with installation and environment variables for Java. Additional jar installation for Postgres. Huge educational moment.

Python script that downloads either .parquet or .csv, infers the schema, and uploads it to Postgres
